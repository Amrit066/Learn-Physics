                <p><span>>> </span> Light moves along at full “light speed” — 186,282.4 miles per second — only in a vacuum. In the dense matrix of a diamond, it slows to just 77,500 miles per second.</p>
                <p><span>>> </span> Eyeglasses can correct vision because light changes speed when it passes from air to a glass or plastic lens; this causes the rays to bend.</p>
                <p><span>>> </span> Plato fancied that we see by shooting light rays from our eyes.</p>
                <p><span>>> </span>The Greek philosopher was not completely wrong. Like all living things, humans are bio­luminescent: We glow. We are brightest during the afternoon, around our lips and cheeks. The cause may be chemical reactions involving molecular fragments known as free radicals.</p>
                <p><span>>> </span>World War II aviators used to spot ships by the bio­luminescence in their wakes. In 1954 Jim Lovell (later the pilot of Apollo 13) used this trick to find his darkened aircraft carrier.</p>

                <p><span>>> </span>A spark of static electricity can measure up to 3,000 volts.</p>
                <p><span>>> </span>Lightning is a discharge of electricity in the atmosphere. Lightning bolts can travel at around 130,000 miles per hour and reach nearly 54,000 °F in temperature.</p>
                <p><span>>> </span>Electric eels can produce strong electric shocks of around 500 volts for both self-defense and hunting.</p>
                <p><span>>> </span>Have you ever wondered why birds sitting on a power line don’t get electrocuted? If a bird sits on just one power line it is safe. However, if the bird touches another line with a wing or a foot, it creates a circuit, causing the electricity to flow through the bird’s body. This results in electrocution.</p>
                <p><span>>> </span>Electricity travels at the speed of light -- more than 186,000 miles per second.</p>

                <p><span>>> </span>Breakfast cereal often contains iron. Some cereals contain enough iron that it’s pieces are attracted to a magnet.</p>
                <p><span>>> </span>The ends of a compass needle always point toward earth’s north and south magnetic poles.</p>
                <p><span>>> </span>If you attach a bar magnet to a piece of wood and float it in a bowl of water, it will slowly turn in the water until the magnet’s North Pole points towards the Earth’s North Pole. Temporary magnets will do the same thing.</p>
                <p><span>>> </span>The Earth’s magnetic field is 1,000 times weaker than a typical bar magnet.</p>
                <p><span>>> </span>Did you know earth’s magnetic poles are always moving? The poles move about 5 miles (40 kilometers) each year.</p>
